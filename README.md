- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ijslenette, pleased ta meet'cha!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning code & web development. I'm a beginner, so just looking to learn & contribute where and how I can.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PHP, Python and refreshing my HTML knowledge - currently familiarising myself with the updated version, HTML5.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on passion projects, or just casual content. Not really looking for serious work opportunities at the moment.
- 📫 How to reach me? Not currently looking to put my social media information out here, but will update my details shortly.
